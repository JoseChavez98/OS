\begin{abstract}
    A Finite State Machine (FMS) is an important abstraction for solving several problems.
    This computational model  is widely used  for many application domains, such as
    matching regular-expression, tokenizing and Huffman decoding.
    These  embarrassingly sequential applications with irregular memory acces patterns perform
    poorly
